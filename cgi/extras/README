There are several optional features that you can add to your site, such as
analytics or site traffic monitoring. If you want to add any of them to your
log server, just create the corresponding file and paste into it whatever
code you need to.

For example, to enable Google Analytics on your log server, create the file
'analytics-head.tmpl' and paste into it the code that Google gives you when
you configure your log server in Google Analytics.

Analytics (included just before </head> tag):
    analytics-header.tmpl

Analytics (included in bottom of footer):
    analytics-footer.tmpl
